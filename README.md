How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

In order to create this project I focussed on making it in stages.  First I wanted to make all the necessary shaped themselves so that my scene had the necessary layout.  After this I focussed on adding the appropriate textures which then allowed me to add the material and lighting.  By working in stages like this, I was able to systematically go through each step and ensure that everything was done properly before moving on.  This approach can be aplied in future work as long as I make a plan first for how I will break down each step.  As an example, I do the same with the games that I make.  First I need to make all the playable characters as well as the actions they can take, next I need to make the world they will be playing in, and lastly I work on adding the necessary detail to make the game tcome to life. 

How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

Similarly to designing software, I take a step by step approach to developing programs.  First I need to understand all the different code components I will need, then I work on implementing them one phase at a time to make sure I did not break anything by just adding it all at once.  One of the strategies I took in developing my 3D scene was to fully undertsnad all the different components within the code base.  Usually I would only focus on what I needed to edit but for this asignment it was crucial to undertsand all components even if they didnt need direct editing.  My approach to coding evolved by me trying different iterations to see how it would affect the scene instead of just trying to build everything all at once.  This allowed me to have a step by step approach where I could see exactly where the errors were coming from.  As an example, at first I tried to implement all my textures at once, which lead to a bunch of errors.  After I encountered this I started to apply my textures one by one so I could see exactly what texture was casuing the error. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

I have the goal of working in the game development industry.  The work in this class has taught me a lot about texturing, lighting, and materials.  While I may not be using OpneGL in the making of modern day games the concepts will stick with me forever.  A perfect example of this is that I did not realize that you needed both a material and a texture to determine how light will interact with an object.  This lesson will greatly benefit me in my future game development goals.  I also believe this class taught me how to identify visual bugs with texturing.  If the texture is not evenly or properly put on an object you can get some strange visual effects that do not fit the scene.  Having the ability to spot this issue will greatly benefit me in my future development goals.
